# LinkedIn-homepage
 https://kirtisharma05.github.io/LinkedIn-homepage/

I've tried to form a statis homepage which exactly looks like LinkedIn Homepage.
I've created this only using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
Some of the sections also shows excatly the same response on hovering or clicking but doesn't leads you to any other page because it was only made for brushing up the frontend skills and I didn't want it to work something, I was just wanted to make it looks like LinkedIn.

My blueprint have some different icons from the actual LinkedIn page as I was unable to find exactly the same for free.
